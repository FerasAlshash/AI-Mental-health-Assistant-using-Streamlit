## Introduction üåü

**AI Mental Health Assistant** is an intelligent application powered by artificial intelligence designed to provide emotional support and guidance to users.
The app analyzes the user's textual or voice inputs, identifies their emotional state, and generates empathetic responses tailored to their current mental condition.

This project aims to create a safe and supportive environment to help individuals manage their emotions in a healthy and structured way.

## Key Features üí°

- **Sentiment Analysis**: The app uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze text or speech and determine the user's emotional state (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear).
- **Empathetic Responses**: Utilizes LLM models (e.g., Ollama) to generate compassionate and personalized responses that acknowledge the user's feelings.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides actionable recommendations based on the user's emotional state, including mindfulness exercises, coping strategies, and trusted resources.
- **Voice Input Support**: Allows users to interact with the assistant using voice commands, making it more accessible and user-friendly.
- **Conversation History**: Tracks and stores conversation history for continuity and context-aware interactions.
- **Emotion Visualization**: Displays the user's emotional state with intuitive visualizations, including icons and intensity levels.
